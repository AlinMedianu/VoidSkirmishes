# VoidSkirmishes
Void Skirmishes is my university dissertation project
that scored a 70% (first). The project is about teaching
programming to novices through the means of a 
multiplayer game.
Research was conducted to achieve the peer-to-peer
networking architecture, the server-client option
was considered as well but in the end, for the scope
of the project and what it wanted to achieve, the
peer-to-peer architecture was chosen. This project
made me research university teaching methods in the UK
to be able to compare them with the way the game would
teach.
The game is written in C++ using SFML, while students 
are meant to learn and write Lua code that is embedded
at runtime in the C++ app using LuaBridge.
